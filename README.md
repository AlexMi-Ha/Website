# Website

This is my Website _(v3)_ served at [alexmiha.de](https://alexmiha.de).

It was built using vanilla html, css and javascript with the add on `Express.js` for serving the site in development and the templating engine `EJS` to have easier layouting.
On build, the app gets compiled to static html files, pushed to the `gh-pages` branch and deployed via `Github Pages`

## Development

Use `npm run watch` to hot reload the app on save. The app will be started on `localhost:3000`

Use `npm run build` to build the app to static html
