    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Your privacy is important to us. This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR, also known as DSGVO in German).</p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>Theming Settings: We use a cookie to save your theming preferences (such as light or dark mode). This cookie ensures that your selected theme is remembered when you revisit our website.</li>
                <li>Like Status: We use a cookie to remember whether you have liked a blog post. This cookie is used solely to determine the UI state (like or unlike button) when you revisit the post and is not forwarded with any request to the server.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Saved on the server:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Visit Counts: We store only aggregate visit counts to monitor traffic and performance. This data is completely anonymized and does not include any personal information.</li>
                <li>Like Counts: We store only aggregate like counts to keep track of the popularity of our blog posts. This data is also completely anonymized and does not include any personal information.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Use of Collected Data</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Theming Settings Cookie: Used to enhance your user experience by remembering your theme preferences.</li>
        <li>Like Status Cookie: Used to improve your user experience by displaying the appropriate button (like or unlike) on blog posts you have interacted with.</li>
        <li>Visit and Like Counts: Displayed on the blog posts to show the popularity and engagement metrics. This information is anonymized and cannot be traced back to any individual user.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Data Protection</h2>

    <p>We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure. To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, we have put in place suitable physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the anonymized data we collect.</p>

    <h2>User Rights</h2>

    <p>Under the GDPR, you have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Access: Request access to any data we might hold about you (though we do not hold any personal data).</li>
        <li>Rectification: Request correction of any inaccurate data (though we do not hold any personal data).</li>
        <li>Erasure: Request the deletion of your personal data (though we do not hold any personal data).</li>
        <li>Restriction: Request restriction of processing your data (though we do not hold any personal data).</li>
        <li>Objection: Object to the processing of your data (though we do not hold any personal data).</li>
        <li>Portability: Request the transfer of your data to another party (though we do not hold any personal data).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Since our data collection methods involve only anonymized and non-personal data, these rights are largely inapplicable. However, we are committed to addressing any concerns or requests related to your data privacy.</p>
