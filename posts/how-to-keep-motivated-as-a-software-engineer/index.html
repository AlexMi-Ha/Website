            <p>We all know it and have experienced it - free time is a valuable resource ‚è≥. I&#39;m in the 6th semester of my computer science degree and have little to no time to work on my personal projects.</p>
<p>With as little of time that is left from the stressful day-to-day life, it is important to maximize not only what actually gets done, but most importantly to have as much fun as possible and to learn something in the progress. üß†</p>
<p>Today I have compiled a small list of tips and tricks I use daily to keep my learning journey running and to stay motivated developing software. üöÄ</p>
<h2><a name="section-the-deadline-is-coming-" class="anchor" href="#section-the-deadline-is-coming-"><span class="header-link"></span></a>The deadline is coming!</h2><p>16! I have 16 dead projects on my hard drive. And that is without the unfinished projects I have collected on GitHub üíÄ -  Why is that?</p>
<p>When I compare my finished projects and most of my unfinished projects there is a clear difference between the two.</p>
<p>Most of my finished projects were planned through. I have set myself specific goals to reach in a specific time frame. üèÅ</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You may have heard of SMART goals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>SMART goals stand for goals that are <em>specific</em>, <em>measurable</em>, <em>achievable</em>, <em>relevant</em> and most importantly <em>time-bound</em>.</p>
<p>Whenever I start a new project, I try my best to keep notes on the most important features I want to implement, a rough roadmap of development and how long I am committing my time to this project. I try to first define what I want out of this project and how it integrates into my ecosystem.</p>
<p>With this I have automatic <em>&#39;scheduling&#39;</em> for my projects, on which project I will work on and when I can start new projects.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And we both know working with a deadline is where most work gets done üëÄ</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a name="section-collaborate-with-others" class="anchor" href="#section-collaborate-with-others"><span class="header-link"></span></a>Collaborate with others</h2><p>Building projects with others significantly boosts your experience and motivation by a lot. I work well when collaborating with others as I know that they depend on me getting my work done. This boosts the motivation to put work into the project. üéà</p>
<p><em>Collaborating with others</em> does not only mean contributing to open source here as many other people say you should do.</p>
<p>Collaborating with others means starting some projects with a few friends. You don&#39;t even have to search for developers better than you. The senior-junior developer and mentoring mindset does make sense, especially when starting out. But building a project, where you are the &#39;senior developer&#39; does improve your engineering skills. What most people miss out on is learning how to properly <strong>start</strong> a project. When you &#39;lead&#39; your project team, you learn a lot of different skills like architecture, design patterns and choosing the right tools. Plus you learn a lot about project management and leading a team. </p>
<p>Working on projects with other people helps me to stay motivated and not abandon another project to ‚ú®the bottom of my GitHub repo list‚ú®. </p>
<h2><a name="section-learn-something-new" class="anchor" href="#section-learn-something-new"><span class="header-link"></span></a>Learn something new</h2><p>When I choose projects to develop, a big factor in the decision is building something, which I will learn a lot from üí°</p>
<p>I try to either explore and set my focus on a topic in software engineering or infrastructure that I want to improve in or to switch up my default tools and maybe use a different database or a different language. üîÄ</p>
<p>That way, developing a web service for the thousandth time does not get boring but is another challenge in itself which results in a lot of motivation going to the project.</p>
<h2><a name="section-keep-a-list" class="anchor" href="#section-keep-a-list"><span class="header-link"></span></a>Keep a list</h2><p>When I was in my 4th and 5th year of learning programming I had a phase where I had no more projects to work on. I ran out of ideas on what to develop - I had no need for any more software.</p>
<p>Nowadays, I have set myself the <em>simple</em> goal of building my own software ecosystem to use in my private homelab üë©‚Äçüíª.</p>
<p>With such a goal, thousands of projects fall out:</p>
<ul>
<li>How can I authenticate to each service -&gt; Create an Identity Server üîê</li>
<li>How can I manage my logs -&gt; Logging Software üìù</li>
<li>Oh no, I have too many passwords -&gt; Password Manager üîí</li>
<li>I want to sync my passwords ONLY in my local network -&gt; Distributed Database Design üíæ</li>
</ul>
<p>...and so on. I keep all of these ideas I have for expanding my ecosystem in a big list. If I want to start a new project I have a lot of ideas lined up in the queue.</p>
<p>Working on a simple, defined and attractive goal of (in my example) hosting a private software ecosystem provided me with a lot of projects to build and a lot of lessons to learn.</p>
<p>Many would say <em>&quot;Don&#39;t reinvent the wheel&quot;</em>, I say <em>&quot;Reinvent the wheel and learn something from it&quot;</em>. You will make errors, but you can compare your solutions to how others have solved the problem and for me, that is a lot of fun! üòÅ</p>
<h2><a name="section-gotta-have-them-metrics" class="anchor" href="#section-gotta-have-them-metrics"><span class="header-link"></span></a>Gotta have them metrics</h2><p>The final trick I use to stay motivated is to always track some kind of metric on how much I got done.</p>
<p>For me, this is my GitHub contribution chart.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wouldn&#39;t say I&#39;m a competitive person. üê∑<br>
~ Technoblade</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I like to look at my contribution chart and see <em>&quot;Oh cool, on this day I&#39;ve gotten to 50 commits!&quot;</em>. üöÄ It fires up my inner gamer and motivates me to maximize productivity based on my contribution chart.</p>
<p>Of course, this is not the only metric you could use - in fact, it probably isn&#39;t the best either. You can use anything that keeps track of how much you have accomplished like completed tickets or something similar.</p>
<h2><a name="section-last-words" class="anchor" href="#section-last-words"><span class="header-link"></span></a>Last Words</h2><p>Those were a few of my tips and tricks on how I stay motivated to develop software.</p>
<p>But always keep in mind: if something you do to force yourself to do more coding is too much for you and drains your motivation you can just try some other method.</p>
<p>The main focus should always be fun - Having fun coding and creating software is the most important thing as a software engineer. üî•</p>
